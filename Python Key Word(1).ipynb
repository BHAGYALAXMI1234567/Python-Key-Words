    "\n",
    "Ans)Keywords are predefined reserved word in python which has some special meaning that python interpreter can understand and does a specific task.These keywords helps us to perform specific task without any difficulty. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name. For eg:- print,True, if, continue, break, etc."

    "Q2 )Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans)The rules for defining identifiers are: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)Identifier names in Python can contain numbers (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), and underscore (_). \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: abd23 #valid way of writing identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)The name should always start with a non-numeric character. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "ABC #valid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "abc #valid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "AbC #valid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "1bc #invalid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)An identifier name should not contain numeric characters only. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "123 #invalid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)Identifier names in Python are case-sensitive like most other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "‘Amlan’ is different from ‘AMLAN’ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)We can begin identifiers with an underscore. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "_ #valid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "_ab #valid way of defining identifier \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•)Identifiers should not have the same name as keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "print #invalid way of defining identifier"

    "Q3 )What are comments in Python, and why are they useful? Provide an example \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans) Comments are line written within python code to make the code more readable by explaining the purpose of writing it. They are written in a way so that they could remain unidentified by the python interpreter which would otherwise throw an error. It is of two types: \n",
    "\n",
    "a) Single line comment: It consist of a single line and start with #. \n",

    "\n",

    "Q4 )Why is proper indentation important in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans )A proper indentation is important in python due to the following reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "•)Improved Readability: Indentation makes the code more readable by clearly indicating which statements belong to which block of code. This makes it easier for other developers to understand your code and makes it more maintainable. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Consistency: By requiring consistent indentation levels, Python ensures that the code follows a consistent style, making it easier to read and understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Reduced Syntax: Python’s use of indentation reduces the amount of syntax required to define blocks of code. This makes Python code shorter and easier to read than code written in other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Reduced Errors: By requiring consistent indentation levels, Python reduces the likelihood of indentation-related errors that can occur in other languages. This improves code quality and reduces the time required for debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Increased Efficiency: Python’s use of indentation simplifies the coding process and allows developers to write code faster and with fewer errors."

    "Q5 )What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans)Incorrect indentation can result in syntax errors and impact the logical structure of your code. Python relies on consistent indentation to identify code blocks, so improper indentation may lead to unexpected behavior or make your code difficult to understand and could also interfer with our decision when to implement a block of code on fulfilment of a specific condition. Therefore it’s essential to pay attention to indentation to ensure the proper execution of your Python programs."

    "Q6)Differentiate between expression and statement in Python with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans) \n",
    "\n",
    "EXPRESSION: \n",
    "\n",
    "•)An Expression is a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that always produces or returns a result value. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Each and every line of code that we write in python could not be called as expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "•) eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5, y = 3, z = x + y \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example x, y and z are variables, 5 and 3 are values, = and + are operators. So, the first combination x = 5 is an expression, the second combination y = 3 is an another expression and at last, z = x + y is also an expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "STATEMENT: \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Statement is the smallest executable unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value. Sentence may or may not return a value \n",
    "\n",
    "•)Each and every line of code that we write in python is called a statement, because, all the lines are executable by the interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "•)eg: \n",
    "\n",
    "x=3 \n",
    "\n",
    "if x>2 and x<10 \n",
    "\n",
    "    x+=1 \n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(x) \n",
    "    \n",
    "else \n",
    "\n",
    "  break \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The first line is an assignment statement that gives a value to x. The second line is a if statement that execute a block of code based on a condition. Similarly there is else statement which has break as it sub code which is note an expression but is a statement. When you type a statement then the interpreter executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. Some other kinds of statements in Python are– if statement, else statement, while statement, for statement, import statement, etc."
